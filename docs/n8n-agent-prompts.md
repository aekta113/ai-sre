# N8N Agent Node Prompts for AI SRE Integration

## ðŸ¤– Overview

This document provides example prompts for N8N Agent nodes to interact with the AI SRE MCP server, demonstrating how to:
- Update Git repositories with fixes
- Find and use available MCP tools
- Access and search runbooks
- Learn from incidents and update knowledge base

## ðŸ“‹ Example Prompts

### 1. **Incident Response Prompt**

```
You are an AI SRE agent with access to Kubernetes cluster management tools. 

INCIDENT ALERT: Pod CrashLoopBackOff detected in production namespace.

Your task:
1. First, check the health of the MCP server using the health_check tool
2. Use kubectl_get to check pod status in the production namespace
3. For any pods in CrashLoopBackOff state, use kubectl_describe to get detailed information
4. Use kubectl_logs to examine the logs of failing pods
5. Based on the analysis, determine the root cause and apply appropriate fixes
6. If the fix involves configuration changes, use git_commit and git_push to update the repository
7. Document the incident resolution in the runbook system for future reference

Available MCP tools: kubectl_get, kubectl_describe, kubectl_logs, git_status, git_commit, git_push, health_check, flux_status, cli_tool

Remember to:
- Always verify the current state before making changes
- Use descriptive commit messages for Git operations
- Document lessons learned for knowledge base updates
- Test your fixes before considering the incident resolved
```

### 2. **Memory Pressure Resolution Prompt**

```
CRITICAL ALERT: High memory usage detected on multiple pods in production.

As an AI SRE agent, follow this procedure:

1. **Investigation Phase**:
   - Use health_check to verify MCP server connectivity
   - Use kubectl_get to list all pods and their status
   - Use cli_tool with kubectl top pods to check memory usage
   - Use kubectl_describe on high-memory pods to check resource limits

2. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Identify pods exceeding 80% memory usage
   - Check for OOMKilled events in pod logs using kubectl_logs
   - Determine if this is a memory leak or insufficient resource allocation

3. **Resolution Phase**:
   - For memory limit issues: Calculate new limits (current usage + 30% safety margin)
   - Use cli_tool with kubectl patch to update memory limits
   - Use kubectl rollout restart to apply changes
   - For memory leaks: Document for development team

4. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Use git_status to check repository state
   - Use git_commit with message: "fix: increase memory limits for [pod-names] due to [reason]"
   - Use git_push to deploy changes
   - Update runbook with resolution details and lessons learned

5. **Verification Phase**:
   - Monitor pod status for 5 minutes
   - Verify memory usage is within acceptable limits
   - Confirm no new OOMKilled events

If this is a recurring pattern, suggest creating a new runbook entry for memory pressure resolution.
```

### 3. **GitOps Deployment Prompt**

   - Use git_push to push changes to main branch

3. **Flux Synchronization**:
   - Use flux_status to monitor synchronization progress
   - Wait for Flux to detect and apply changes
   - Verify deployment using kubectl_get to check pod status

4. **Verification**:
   - Use kubectl_get to verify new pods are running
   - Use kubectl_logs to check application startup logs
   - Use health_check on the deployed service
   - Monitor for any deployment issues

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document successful deployment in runbook
